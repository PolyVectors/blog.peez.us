		<h1 class="title">Writing an Assembler: How and Why?</h1>
		<h2 style="text-align: right;">27/04/2025</h2>

		<p>About 2 months ago I discovered <a href="https://urbit.org">Urbit.</a></p>
		<p>Its a weird little (kinda unix-like?) operating system written in about 30,000 LOC, it isn't based on any existing code such as a Linux or *BSD kernel and it's involved in some weird crypto stuff for some reason &mdash; but that's besides the point.</p>
		<p>What interested me about the operating system was how it was implemented, the underlying language, <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a>.<p/>

		<h1>What's a <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a>?</h1>

		<p>As the team behind Urbit puts it, <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> is a "low-level functional programming language" or a "Turing-complete function that maps a cell <code>[subject formula]</code> to a noun <code>product</code>, where <code>subject</code> is the data, <code>formula</code> is the code, and <code>product</code> is the result." but let's not worry about that second definition...<p/>
		<p>The part that interested <i>me</i> about <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> was how tiny some implementations of the language are.</p>

		<p>Here are some statistics:</p>

	 	<ul>
	 		<li>The C implementation of <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> is just 241 LOC <b>including comments.</b></li>
  			<li>Steve Dee's implementation of <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> in Haskell is just <b>50 LOC.</b></li>
		</ul>

		<p>This by itself is crazy enough but there are already tiny implementations of other languages such as Brainfuck but what sets <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> apart is that it is <b>not a toy</b>. This language being the base of an entire operating system shows how the power of a language is not correlated to its size at all.</p>
		<p>The idea of a <a href="https://docs.urbit.org/language/nock">Nock</a> to me represents a tiny (yet extremely powerful) low-level systems programming language. So I wanted to bulid my own.</p>

		<p>Let's set some ground rules:</p>
		
		<!--
		<div class="outer-code">
			<p class="code-title">main.c</p>
			<pre class="inner-code"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
	printf("Hello, world!");
	return 0;
}</code></pre>
